            <p>The Date Accuracy Indicator code system defines concepts that indicate the accuracy
                of components of a reported date. The concepts defined in this code system are
                equivalent to those defined in the METeOR value domains for Date—accuracy indicator,
                code AAA (http://meteor.aihw.gov.au/content/index.phtml/itemId/294429).</p>
