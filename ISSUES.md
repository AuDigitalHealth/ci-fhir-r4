# Reporting issues or queries

Issues can be used to:

* Report a defect
* Request a new feature or enhancement
* Ask a question

First, please search the [open issues](https://github.com/AuDigitalHealth/ci-fhir-stu3/issues?q=is%3Aopen) and [closed issues](https://github.com/AuDigitalHealth/ci-fhir-stu3/issues?q=is%3Aclosed) to see if your issue hasn't already been reported (it may also be fixed).

If you can't find an issue that matches what you're seeing, open a new issue and select from the following two options:

1. Bug report - automatically populated with a [template](.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/bug_report.md) that highlights the information that needs to be submitted with a bug report.
2. Issue or new feature - automatically populated with a [template](.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/issue_or_new_feature.md) that highlights the information that needs to be submitted with an issue / new feature.

If the issue is not related to either of the above, please just delete the template and replace it with a detailed description of the problem you are trying to solve, or the question being asked.

Please provide us with enough information to investigate further.
