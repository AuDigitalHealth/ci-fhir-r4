# Guidelines for git commit message format
The following guidelines will assist the review of prospective pull requests.

## Preferred git commit message style
* Provide a brief description of the change in the first line
* The first line should be limited to 50 characters and should not end with a period
* Separate subject from body with a blank line
* Use the body to explain what and why you have done something. In most cases, you can leave out details about how a change has been made. 
* Capitalize the subject line and each paragraph
* Use the imperative mood in the subject line
* Wrap lines at 72 characters


## Example commit message

```
Short (50 chars or less) summary

Refer to issue #<IssueId>

More detailed explanatory text. Wrap it to 72 characters. The blank
line separating the summary from the body is critical (unless you omit
the body entirely).

Write your commit message in the imperative: "Fix bug" and not "Fixed
bug" or "Fixes bug." This convention matches up with commit messages
generated by commands like git merge and git revert.

Further paragraphs come after blank lines.

- Bullet points are okay, too.
- Typically a hyphen or asterisk is used for the bullet, followed by a
  single space. Use a hanging indent.
