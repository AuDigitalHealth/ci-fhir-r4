This information includes diagnosis, clinical findings and other observations.  In laboratory ordering these are typically referred to as ""ask at order entry questions (AOEs)"".  This includes observations explicitly requested by the producer (filler) to provide context or supporting information needed to complete the order. For example,  reporting the amount of inspired oxygen for blood gas measurements.","To represent information about how the services are to be delivered use the `instructions` element.","","","","","","","","",,,,,"",,,,"ServiceRequest.supportingInfo",0,*,"","ele-1:All FHIR elements must have a @value or children {hasValue() or (children().count() > id.count())}
