New pull requests within this project's repository are pre-populated with a [checklist](PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md) that describes the Definition of Done that we assess all new changes against. It is ok to submit a pull request that has not yet addressed all of these items, but be aware that the change will not be merged until it meets the Definition of Done.

Please communicate with us (preferably through creation of an issue) before embarking on any significant work within a pull request. This will prevent situations where people are working at cross-purposes.
