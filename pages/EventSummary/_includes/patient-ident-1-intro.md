#### Patient with Mandatory Identifier *[[Draft](http://hl7.org/fhir/r4/valueset-publication-status.html)]*
The purpose of this profile is to define a representation of a patient for exchange usage scenarios in an Australian context where unambiguous identification of a patient is mandatory. This profile is intended to support the electronic exchange of health information between healthcare providers in Australia.

This profile supports the exchange of some of the Cultural and Linguistic Diversity (CALD) data set [<sup>[1]</sup>](https://www.abs.gov.au/AUSSTATS/abs@.nsf/Latestproducts/1289.0Main%20Features11999) [<sup>[2]</sup>](https://meteor.aihw.gov.au/content/index.phtml/itemId/491352), including a patient's country of birth, year of arrival and preferred language.

#### Implementation guidance
For the overarching usage scenarios in this implementation guide it is expected that:
<ul>
  <li>country of birth is sent in the extension <a href="http://hl7.org/fhir/R4/extension-patient-birthplace.html">patient-birthPlace</a></li>
  <li>when representing a local identifier for a patient, if there isnâ€™t a local identifier namespace available, then an identifier can be sent with a <a href="http://ns.electronichealth.net.au/id/hpio-scoped/service-provider-individual/1.0/index.html">HPI-O scoped</a> or <a href="http://ns.electronichealth.net.au/id/abn-scoped/service-provider-individual/1.0/index.html">ABN-scoped</a> identifier namespace (see the <a href="https://github.com/AuDigitalHealth/ci-fhir-r4/wiki/Frequently-Asked-Questions">FAQ</a> for more information)</li>
  <li>a maximum of one Individual Healthcare Identifier is present (ihiNumber)</li>
  <li>an Australian address conforms to <a href="http://build.fhir.org/ig/hl7au/au-fhir-base/StructureDefinition-au-address.html">AU Base Address</a></li>
  <li>that the generalPractitioner will</li>
    <ul>
	  <li>include the patient's nominated primary care provider</li>
      <li>be sent as a PractitionerRole, unless a named practitioner is unable to be identified, in which case an Organization is sent instead</li>
       <li>not be sent as both a PractitionerRole and Organization when the Organization is already identified within the PractitionerRole instance</li>
	</ul>   
</ul>

When sending communication preferences for a patient the guidance in the following table applies.

#### Boundaries and relationships
Other related patient attributes, ostensibly considered to be demographic in nature, are better represented in other resources rather than directly part of the Patient. These attributes may include:
* a patient's biological sex - this is a testable observation about a biological property of a patient, and as such should be represented using an [Observation](http://hl7.org/fhir/observation.html) resource. See the discussion on this in the [FHIR specification](http://hl7.org/fhir/patient.html#gender). 
* a patient's pregnancy status - this is a transient clinical statement better represented using the [Condition](http://hl7.org/fhir/condition.html) resource
* various social determinants of health (such as housing status, employment status or socio-economic background) - these patient attributes are better tracked using a combination of other resources such as [Observation](http://hl7.org/fhir/observation.html), [Condition](http://hl7.org/fhir/condition.html) or [Flag](http://hl7.org/fhir/flag.html)

Forthcoming work on these related attributes in collaboration with HL7 AU is expected to result in profiles published as part of [HL7 AU Base Implementation Guide](http://build.fhir.org/ig/hl7au/au-fhir-base/index.html).
