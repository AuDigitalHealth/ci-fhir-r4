Where a URI is not available, additional narrative might be included stating a phone number or other contact details for further enquiry.</p>
        <p>This is a requirement in Diagnostic Imaging Report but still under consideration as to whether or not this is to be supported for Pathology Reports.</p>
        <p>Possibly an endPoint extension may be useful, possibly a simple extension for only the use case is appropriate.</p></td>

The Snapshot Table only presents the constraints visible in the Differential Table and additionally presents those constraints set in slices in the base profile.</td>
