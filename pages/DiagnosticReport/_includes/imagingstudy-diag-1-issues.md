      <td>AU Base Imaging Study</td>
      <td><p>An HL7 AU Base ImagingStudy has yet to be developed. When available in <a href="http://build.fhir.org/ig/hl7au/au-fhir-base/index.html">HL7 AU Base Implementation Guide</a>, this profile will be derived from the HL7 AU profile.</p>
      <p>It is expected that the HL7 AU profile will support localised terminology and identifiers.</p></td>

      <td>This profile is a straw-man design to facilitate engagement and discussion on profiling <a href="http://hl7.org/fhir/R4/imagingstudy.html">ImagingStudy</a>, it also serves as an indication that we do want a profile of this resource and to have this referenced by imaging observations included in diagnostic imaging reports.</td>

      <td>Constraint presentation</td>
      <td>The full set of constraints (i.e. invariants) defined in this profile are only presented in the Detailed Descriptions tab or the raw representation (e.g. XML) of the profile. The Differential Table only presents constraints introduced in this profile in addition to the constraints present in the base profile and base resource. The Snapshot Table only presents the constraints visible in the Differential Table and additionally presents those constraints set in slices in the base profile.</td>
