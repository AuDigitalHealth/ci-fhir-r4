**Validator pack and definitions**

The following file contains the profiles and extensions described as part of this implementation guide:
- [Validator Pack](validator.pack)

In addition there are format specific definitions files:
- [XML](definitions.xml.zip)
- [JSON](definitions.json.zip)
- [TTL](definitions.ttl.zip)

The above complete definitions are the most suitable choice for generating implementations of profiles described in this guide. See the overview on [validating FHIR<sup>&reg;</sup> profiles and resources](http://hl7.org/fhir/r4/validation.html) for more information about validating profiles and how to use these artifacts.

**Examples** 

All examples included in this implementation guide are available for download in format specific files:

- [XML](examples.xml.zip)
- [JSON](examples.json.zip)
- [TTl](examples.ttl.zip)

**CDA implementation guide**

CDA implementation guides that use the profiles referenced by this FHIR implementation guide as ‘models’ that are mapped into CDA are available for download:

TBD <!-- - [DH_xxxx_DianosticReport_CDA_IG_v2.0.pdf](..\..\..\ci-fhir-r4\pages\DiagnosticReport\_includes\DH_xxxx_DiagnosticReport_CDA_IG_v2.0.pdf)-->

Approved releases of CDA implementation guides for use in implementation are published on the Agency’s [developer centre](https://developer.digitalhealth.gov.au/).
