     <td>qualification (terminology binding)</td>
     <td>The example value set does not include some key Australian qualifications such as AHPRA and MBBS. We need a broader value set that includes a set of codes which represent the possible qualifications, licences or registrations that a health practitioner may hold in Australia.</td>

     <td>Constraint presentation</td>
     <td>The full set of constraints (i.e. invariants) defined in this profile are only presented in the Detailed Descriptions tab or the raw representation (e.g. XML) of the profile. The Differential Table only presents constraints introduced in this profile in addition to the constraints present in the base profile and base resource. The Snapshot Table only presents the constraints visible in the Differential Table and additionally presents those constraints set in slices in the base profile.</td>
