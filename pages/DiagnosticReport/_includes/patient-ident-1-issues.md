    <td>Country of birth (missing implementation guidance)</td>
    <td>A patient's country of birth can be sent multiple ways using the birthPlace extension - e.g. using Address.text or Address.country. At this time the preferred option has not been identified.</td>

    <td>multipleBirth[x] (missing support for birth plurality)</td>
    <td>The element multipleBirth[x] offers a choice between multipleBirthBoolean or multipleBirthInteger (e.g. '2' to indicate the 2nd born), but does not allow recording the total number of births from one pregnancy - e.g. 2nd of 4. Clinical and jurisdiction feedback indicate that this is a useful data point to collect, to facilitate identification. This work is expected to be progressed via HL7 AU, with an extension being added to the <a href="http://build.fhir.org/ig/hl7au/au-fhir-base/index.html">HL7 AU Base Implementation Guide</a>.</td>
