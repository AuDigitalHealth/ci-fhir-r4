#### My Health Record Diagnostic Imaging Report
The purpose of this profile is to define a short form representation of a diagnostic imaging report, providing a rich text representation of the report as issued by the diagnostic service provider with supporting key elements of clinical relevance. This profile is intended to support the electronic exchange of diagnostic imaging reports between healthcare providers and the My Health Record system infrastructure in Australia.

A Diagnostic Imaging Report is created by an authoring imaging provider in response to a diagnostic imaging order and contains a radiologistâ€™s analysis of one or more examination results. There is a single PDF attachment of the original diagnostic report that may itself contain one or more diagnostic imaging examination results. Thus the values of diagnostic report elements that are present in both a FHIR resource and the PDF document shall be consistent.

There are specific requirements related to the management of diagnostic imaging results provided to the My Health Record system, which are managed by the My Health Record system itself.

A registered portal or registered repository shall not be a producer of a diagnostic imaging report.

#### Usage scenarios
The following are the overarching usage scenarios this profile is intended to support:
* A clinical information system (CIS) sends or receives a diagnostic imaging report with the My Health Record system
* A contracted service provider (CSP) sends or receives a diagnostic imaging report with the My Health Record system
* A CSP sends or receives a diagnostic imaging report with a CIS or another CSP
* A registered portal or registered repository receives a diagnostic imaging report

#### Implementation guidance
For the overarching usage scenarios in this implementation guide it is expected that:
<ul>
<li>one identifier is an Accession Number</li>
<li>a local identifier is sent with a <a href="http://ns.electronichealth.net.au/id/hpio-scoped/report/1.0/index.html">HPI-O scoped</a> if there isn't a local namespace available (see the <a href="https://github.com/AuDigitalHealth/ci-fhir-r4/wiki/Frequently-Asked-Questions">FAQ</a>) for more information)</li>
<li>status is 'preliminary', 'final', or 'amended'</li>
<li>category is sent with additional categories indicating the diagnostic service that performed each imaging examination referenced in the report</li>
<li>code matches one Observation.code referenced in result</li>
<li>effective[x] is the date time the imaging study was performed</li>
<li>performer is sent as a reference to a PractitionerRole resource with:
    <ul>
        <li>PractitionerRole.identifier as a HPI-I</li>
        <li>PractitionerRole.practitioner as reference to a Practitioner resource with:
        <ul>
            <li>Practitioner.name.family</li>
            <li>Practitioner.telecom</li>   
            <li>Practitioner.address</li>   
        </ul></li>
        <li>PractitionerRole.organization as reference to an Organization resource with:
        <ul>
            <li>Organization.identifier as a HPI-O</li>
            <li>Organization.name</li>
            <li>Organization.address</li> 
         </ul></li>
        <li>PractitionerRole.code describing the professional role, e.g. 66862007 |Radiologist|</li>
    </ul></li>
<li>The set of performers is consistent with each Observation.performer referenced in the report</li>
<li>the attached PDF is viewable by any individual that is a My Health Record participant; it does not have any of these features: encryption, password protection, printing or copying restrictions, embedded fonts (as not all PDF viewers support them)</li>
</ul>

When sending a report of a multi-modality procedure:
<ul>
<li>result is sent with the Observation representing the multi-modality procedure observation</li>  
<li>code is sent with the same code in that multi-modality procedure Observation</li>  
<li>the individual component examinations are referenced by that Observation (Observtion.hasMember) and not directly referenced by the DiagnosticReport</li>  
</ul>
