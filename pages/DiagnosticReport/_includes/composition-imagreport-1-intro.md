#### Diagnostic Imaging Report
The purpose of this profile is to define a representation of a diagnostic imaging report, as a document, to be electronically exchanged between healthcare providers, and between healthcare providers and the My Health Record system infrastructure in Australia.

A Diagnostic Imaging Report is created by an authoring imaging provider in response to a diagnostic imaging order and contains a radiologistâ€™s analysis of one or more examination results. The original diagnostic report may be attached in one or more formats (e.g. PDF and MS Word format) that may contain one or more diagnostic imaging examination results.

A registered portal or registered repository shall not be a producer of a diagnostic imaging report.

There are specific requirements related to the management of diagnostic imaging results provided to the My Health Record system, which are managed by the My Health Record system itself.

#### Usage scenarios
The following are the overarching usage scenarios this profile is intended to support:
* A clinical information system (CIS) sends or receives a diagnostic imaging report document with the My Health Record system
* A contracted service provider (CSP) sends or receives a diagnostic imaging report document with the My Health Record system
* A CIS sends or receives a diagnostic imaging report document with another CIS or CSP
* A CSP sends or receives a diagnostic imaging report document with a CIS or another CSP
* A registered portal or registered repository receives a diagnostic imaging report document

#### Implementation guidance
For the overarching usage scenarios in this implementation guide the guidance in the following table applies.

When sending to the My Health Record system it is expected that:
* all instances of patient conform to [My Health Record Patient](StructureDefinition-patient-mhr-1.html)
* the diagnostic report conforms to [My Health Record Diagnostic Imaging Report](StructureDefinition-diagnosticreport-imag-mhr-1.html)

#### Boundaries and relationships
This Composition profile is intended to support exchange using a document wrapper to enclose the diagnostic report, thus the values of diagnostic report elements that are present in both the DiagnosticReport resource and the Composition resource shall be consistent. [My Health Record Diagnostic Imaging Report](StructureDefinition-diagnosticreport-imag-mhr-1.html) or [Atomic Diagnostic Imaging Report](StructureDefinition-diagnosticreport-imag-atomic-1.html) may also be used in sending a diagnostic report without a document wrapper.
