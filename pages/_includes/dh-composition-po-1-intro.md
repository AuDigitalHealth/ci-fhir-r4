#### Australian Digital Health Agency Personal Observations Composition
The purpose of this profile is to define a representation of a Personal Observations document for a patient for the electronic exchange of health information between individuals, healthcare providers, and the My Health Record system infrastructure in Australia. A Personal Observations document allows for a nominated or authorised representative to record and viewing of childhood measurement information such as a childâ€™s height, weight and head circumference. A composition is a set of resources composed into a single coherent clinical statement that may have clinical attestation.

This profile identifies the additional constraints, extensions, and value sets that build on and extend [Composition](http://hl7.org/fhir/R4/composition.html) that are supported. 

This profile supports the equivalent of a HL7 CDA instance conformance Level 3A or 3B clinical document as defined in the Agency's Common Conformance Profile for Clinical Documents.

This profile is designed to set a Composition standard for:
* Query for a Personal Observations document for a patient
