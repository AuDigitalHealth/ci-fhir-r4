#### ADHA Personal Health Notes Composition
The purpose of this profile is to define a representation of a Personal Health Notes document for a patient for the electronic exchange of health information between individuals, healthcare providers, and the My Health Record system infrastructure in Australia. A composition is a set of resources composed into a single coherent clinical statement that may have clinical attestation.

This profile identifies the additional constraints, extensions, and value sets that build on and extend [Composition](http://hl7.org/fhir/R4/composition.html) that are supported. 

Due to the nature of this document type with a single narrative only section, this profile supports the equivalent of a HL7 CDA instance conformance Level 1B, Level 2, Level 3A and 3B clinical document as defined in the Agency's Common Conformance Profile for Clinical Documents.

This profile is designed to set a Composition standard for:
* Query for a Personal Health Notes document for a patient
* Record or update a Personal Health Notes document for a patient

This profile is used by the following APIs:
