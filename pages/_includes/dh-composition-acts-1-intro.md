#### ADHA Aged Care Transfer Summary Composition
The purpose of this profile is to define a representation of an Aged Care Transfer Summary for a patient for the electronic exchange of health information between individuals, healthcare providers, and the My Health Record system infrastructure in Australia. A transfer summary includes critical information for exchange of information between providers of care when a patient moves between health care settings. A composition is a set of resources composed into a single coherent clinical statement that may have clinical attestation.

This profile identifies the additional constraints, extensions, and value sets that build on and extend [Composition](http://hl7.org/fhir/R4/composition.html) that are supported. 

This profile supports the equivalent of a HL7 CDA instance conformance Level 3A or 3B clinical document as defined in the Agency's Common Conformance Profile for Clinical Documents.

This profile is designed to set a Composition standard for:
* Query for an Aged Care Transfer Summary for a patient
* Record or update an Aged Care Transfer Summary for a patient

This profile is used by the following APIs:
