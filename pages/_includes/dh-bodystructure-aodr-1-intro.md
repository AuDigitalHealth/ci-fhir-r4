The purpose of this profile is to represent an organ or tissue that may be donated in the event of an individual's death for the electronic exchange of organ donation as recorded on the Australian Organ Donor Register between individuals, healthcare providers, and the My Health Record system infrastructure in Australia.

This profile identifies the additional constraints, extensions, and value sets that build on and extend [BodyStructure](http://hl7.org/fhir/R4/bodystructure.html) that are supported. 

This profile is designed to set a BodyStructure standard for:
* Recording or updating body structures in an AODR record of consent (Consent) resource
* Reading body structures in an AODR record of consent (Consent) resource

Operations, including querying, on body structures in an AODR record of consent (BodyStructure resource) are expected to be within the context of a Consent resource query.
