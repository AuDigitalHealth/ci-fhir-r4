The purpose of this profile is to define a core representation of a practitioner acting as an author or observer in a healthcare role, on behalf of an organisation, that is for the electronic exchange of health information between individuals, healthcare providers, and the My Health Record system infrastructure in Australia.
In the context of an exchange of health information a practitioner role is part of the context established for a set of healthcare-related information.

This profile identifies the additional constraints, extensions, and value sets that build on and extend [PractitionerRole](http://hl7.org/fhir/R4/practitionerrole.html) that are supported. 

A [PractitionerRole](http://hl7.org/fhir/R4/practitionerrole.html) resource is used within the context of a referencing resource. 

This profile is designed to set a PractitionerRole standard for:
* Recording or updating an authoring practitioner role referenced by another resource
* Reading authoring practitioner roles referenced by another resource
