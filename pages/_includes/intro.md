<!-- <p style="border:3px; border-style:solid; border-color:#FF0000; padding: 1em;"><b>June 2022 QA Preview</b><br>Release 1.0.0 is limited to the FHIR R4 conformance artefacts that define the controls on data persistence for the following record types: Australian Immunisation Register, Australian Organ Donor Register, PBS/RPBS Claim Information, MBS/DVA Claim Information.<br><br>The FHIR R4 conformance artefacts are a set of StructureDefinitions that define the FHIR structures required, the data element definitions, and their associated rules of usage including the use of extensions and terminology. These conformance artefacts will be published in an Agency FHIR NPM package for use with FHIR and FHIR-aware tools. The FHIR package contains the validation form (JSON + SCH) of the conformance artefacts for direct use in validation operations and example resource instances that demonstrate use cases and conformance requirements.<br><br>While these artefacts and their package have been developed in conjunction with this Agency FHR implementation guide â€“ publication and release of the implementation guide is not in scope. The implementation guide is provided to assist readers and users in understanding the Agency FHIR NPM package.</p>-->  


This Australian Digital Health Agency Implementation Guide contains:
* Australian Digital Health Agency FHIR [policy](policy.html): the policy for defining, using, maintaining, and implementing using FHIR version R4 within the Australian Digital Health Agency
* Australian Digital Health Agency FHIR [guidance](guidance.html): guidance and clarification on how FHIR resources are used in accordance with the policy
* Australian Digital Health Agency FHIR assets:
  * [capability statements](conformance.html):
  * [profiles](profiles.html): additional rules and constraints that build on and extend the HL7<sup>TM</sup> AU [Australian Base Implementation Guide (AU Base 2)](http://build.fhir.org/ig/hl7au/au-fhir-base/index.html) and HL7<sup>TM</sup> [FHIR<sup>&reg;</sup>, Release 4 (v{{ site.data.fhir.version }}) [HL7FHIR4]](#HL7FHIR4). 
  * [extensions](extensions.html): that form part of an Australian Digital Health Agency FHIR Profiles.
  * [terminology](terminology.html): 
  * [maps](structuremaps.html): 
  * [search parameters and operations](searchparams.html): 
  * ....
* Exchange standards:
  * RESTful API A (FHIR) resource exchange framework. A set of core search parameters can be found on the resource profile pages (see Resource Index below)
  * FHIR Messaging: A messaging exchange framework. The FHIR equivalent of HL7v2 messaging
  * FHIR Documents: A document based exchange framework. The FHIR equivalent of HL7v3 CDA (clinical document architecture)

This material forms the base standard for Australian Digital Health Agency FHIR R4 APIs. Each API will have additional conformance requirements, including FHIR profiles, extensions, and resources that are found in the API documentation in Australian Digital Health Agency API Catalogue[TBD](https://developer.digitalhealth.gov.au/taxonomy/term/361/all).
