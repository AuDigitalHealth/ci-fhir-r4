#### Health Program Participation Observation
The purpose of this profile is to provide a representation of an individual's participation in a health program, e.g. disease screening or substance use therapy. Participation information may include information on an individual's eligibility for a program, suspension of participation in a program, or status of participation in a program.. 

This profile standardises the core, or common set of health program participation information as component observations. The currently available set of component observations includes some alignment with the data set for monitoring public health program participation, e.g. [National Bowel Cancer Screening Program NBEDS 2022â€“23](https://meteor.aihw.gov.au/content/index.phtml/itemId/742048). 

This profile and the linked examples demonstrate outcomes of design meetings 02 and 08 FEB 2022. These are intended to be used only for design elaboration activities and is reflective of the proposed HL7 AU structure. ADHA profile will derive and constrain to support project-specific NCSR to MHR integration requirements.
