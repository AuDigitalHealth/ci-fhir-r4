#### ADHA Advance Care Planning Composition
The purpose of this profile is to define a representation of an Advance Care Planning document that includes an attached Advance Care Plan for a patient for the electronic exchange of health information between individuals, healthcare providers, and the My Health Record system infrastructure in Australia. A composition is a set of resources composed into a single coherent clinical statement that may have clinical attestation.

This profile identifies the additional constraints, extensions, and value sets that build on and extend [Composition](http://hl7.org/fhir/R4/composition.html) that are supported.

* Record or update a advance care planning document composition belonging to a patient
