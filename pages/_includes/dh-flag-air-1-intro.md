The purpose of this profile is to define a notice, such as an exemption record or notification of completion of an immunisation schedule, from the Australian Immunisation Register for the electronic exchange of digital health information between individuals, healthcare providers, and the My Health Record system infrastructure in Australia.

This profile identifies the additional constraints, extensions, and value sets that build on and extend [Flag](http://hl7.org/fhir/R4/flag.html) that are supported. 

This profile is designed to set a Flag standard for:
* Query for a flag (e.g. warning or notification) provided by the Australian Immunisation Register associated with a patient
* Record or update a flag provided by the Australian Immunisation Register associated with a patient
