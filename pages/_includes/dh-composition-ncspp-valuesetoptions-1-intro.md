#### ADHA National Cancer Screening Program Participation Composition
This profile elaborates the section type value set member options to support design activities for [ADHA National Cancer Screening Program Participation Composition](StructureDefinition-dh-composition-ncspp-1.html). The purpose of [that](StructureDefinition-dh-composition-ncspp-1.html) profile is to define a representation of a National Cancer Screening Program Participation document that describes a patient's participation in one or more national cancer screening programs at a point in time for the electronic exchange of health information between individuals, healthcare providers, and the My Health Record system infrastructure in Australia. A composition is a set of resources composed into a single coherent clinical statement that may have clinical attestation.

This profile identifies the additional constraints, extensions, and value sets that build on and extend [Composition](http://hl7.org/fhir/R4/composition.html) that are supported. 

This profile supports the equivalent of a HL7 CDA instance conformance Level 3A or 3B clinical document as defined in the Agency's Common Conformance Profile for Clinical Documents.

This profile is designed to set a Composition standard for:
* Query for a National Cancer Program Participation View for a patient
* Query for a National Bowel Cancer Screening Program Participation Record document for a patient
