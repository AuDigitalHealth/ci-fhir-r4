The purpose of this profile is to define a representation of a record of a claim against the Medicare Benefits Schedule (MBS) or Department of Veterans' Affairs (DVA) for the electronic exchange of digital health information between individuals, healthcare providers, and the My Health Record system infrastructure in Australia.

This profile identifies the additional constraints, extensions, and value sets that build on and extend [ExplanationOfBenefit](http://hl7.org/fhir/R4/explanationofbenefit.html) that are supported. 

This profile is designed to set an ExplanationOfBenefit standard for:
* Query for a record of an MBS or DVA item claim associated with a patient
* Record or update an MBS or DVA item claim associated with a patient


#### Profile specific guidance
- In an exchange with the My Health Record system references to a ServiceRequest resource will be [contained](http://hl7.org/fhir/R4/references.html#contained).


#### Boundaries and relationships
This profile is not referenced by another profile in this implementation guide.
