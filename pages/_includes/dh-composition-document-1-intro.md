#### Australian Digital Health Agency Document Composition
The purpose of this profile is to provide a document composition for the electronic exchange of health information between individuals, healthcare providers, and the My Health Record system infrastructure in Australia. A composition is a set of resources composed into a single coherent clinical statement that may have clinical attestation.

This profile identifies the additional constraints, extensions, and value sets that build on and extend [Composition](http://hl7.org/fhir/R4/composition.html) that are supported. 

Where a more specific document composition profile is applicable, e.g. shared health summary or personal health notes, an implementation **SHALL** ensure the Resource conforms to that specific profile.

This profile supports the equivalent of all HL7 CDA conformance levels for a clinical document as defined in the Agency's Common Conformance Profile for Clinical Documents.

This profile is designed to set a Composition standard for:
* exchanging a FHIR Document
* Query for a document for a patient
* Record or update a document record for a patient
