#### ADHA National Cancer Screening Program Participation Observation
The purpose of this profile is to provide a representation of an individual's participation in a national cancer screening program, e.g. national bowel cancer screening program for the electronic exchange of health information between individuals, healthcare providers, the National Cancer Screening Register, and the My Health Record system infrastructure in Australia. Participation information may include information on an individual's eligibility for a program, suspension of participation in a program, or status of participation in a program.

This profile identifies the additional constraints, extensions, and value sets that build on and extend [Observation](http://hl7.org/fhir/R4/observation.html) that are supported. 

This profile is designed to set an Observation standard for:
* Query for a national bowel cancer screening program participation observation for a patient
