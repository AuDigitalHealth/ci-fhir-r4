Observation of a condition arising after the onset of labour and before the completed delivery of the baby and placenta. May affect mother or baby.

#### Guidance
TBD

#### Boundaries and relationships
This includes complications that affect the mother or the baby.

The relevant SNOMED CT-AU concepts are  199745000\|Complication occurring during labour and delivery\| and 414025005\|Disorder of fetus or newborn\|

The Australian Institute of Health and Welfare (AIHW) concept [Birth event-complication](https://meteor.aihw.gov.au/content/index.phtml/itemId/269436) is similar. However it excludes complications not necessitating intervention. 

#### Known Issues
This is an observation and the closest relevant SNOMED CT codes are disorders. A new code may be required.
