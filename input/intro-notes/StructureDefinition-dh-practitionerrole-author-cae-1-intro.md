The purpose of this profile is to define a representation of a care agency employee (practitioner) acting as an author or observer, on behalf of an organisation, for the electronic exchange of health information between individuals, healthcare providers, and the My Health Record system infrastructure in Australia.
In the context of an exchange of health information a practitioner role is part of the context established for a set of healthcare-related information.

This profile identifies the additional constraints, extensions, and value sets that build on and extend [PractitionerRole](http://hl7.org/fhir/R4/practitionerrole.html) that are supported. 

A [PractitionerRole](http://hl7.org/fhir/R4/practitionerrole.html) resource is used within the context of a referencing resource. 

This profile is designed to set a PractitionerRole standard for:
* Recording or updating an authoring care agency employee referenced by another resource
* Reading an authoring care agency employee referenced by another resource

This profile may be referred to by APIs, which will be listed here when available.
