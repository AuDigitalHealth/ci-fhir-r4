#### Known Issues
A suitable code for this concept has not yet been chosen. SNOMED CT has two distinct concepts related to this concept: [cervical ripening](https://browser.ihtsdotools.org/?perspective=full&amp;conceptId1=236959001&amp;edition=MAIN/2022-01-31&amp;release=&amp;languages=en) and 
[induction of labour](https://browser.ihtsdotools.org/?perspective=full&amp;conceptId1=236958009&amp;edition=MAIN/2022-01-31&amp;release=&amp;languages=en). Both are procedures. It is best if a single finding code identifies this concept.
