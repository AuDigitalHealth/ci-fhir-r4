This profile identifies the additional constraints, extensions, and value sets that build on and extend [Condition](http://hl7.org/fhir/R4/condition.html) that are supported. 

This profile is designed to set a core Condition standard for:
* Query for a patient's conditions
* Record or update a condition belonging to a patient

This profile may be referred to by APIs, which will be listed here when available.


### Profile specific guidance
- `Condition.category` provides an efficient way of supporting system interactions, e.g. restricting searches. Implementers need to understand that data categorisation is somewhat subjective. The categorisation applied by the source may not align with a receiverâ€™s expectations. 
- An active condition is represented using "active" in `Condition.clinicalStatus`.
- To represent that a patient does not have a condition or history of condition, an appropriate negation code is used in `Condition.code`.
- Refutation is not expected to be handled except as above - an appropriate negation code in `Condition.code` and `Condition.verificationStatus` of "confirmed" or "unconfirmed".
