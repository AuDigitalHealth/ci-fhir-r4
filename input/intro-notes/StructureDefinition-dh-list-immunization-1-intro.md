The purpose of this profile is to define a representation of list that describes a patient's immunisation history at a point in time for the electronic exchange of health information between individuals, healthcare providers, and the My Health Record system infrastructure in Australia. The list may be partial, or complete, and may be scoped to a single source of vaccination information.

This profile identifies the additional constraints, extensions, and value sets that build on and extend [List](http://hl7.org/fhir/R4/list.html) that are supported. 

This profile is designed to set a List standard for:
* Query for a patient's immunization history
* Record or update a patient's immunization history

This profile may be referred to by APIs, which will be listed here when available.


### Profile specific guidance
