This profile provides an observation information structure for a measurement of patientâ€™s Apgar score. A measurement of physical condition within minutes of birth. 

The score is based on the assessment of 5 characteristics: heart rate, respiratory condition, muscle tone, reflex irritability and skin colour.

This profile may be referred to by APIs, which will be listed here when available.

#### Usage Notes

Apgar scores are frequently made of a baby at 1 and 5 minutes after birth. They are rarely taken after that.

The Australian Institute of Health and Welfare (AIHW) equivalents to this concept are [Product of birth - Apgar score at 1 minute](https://meteor.aihw.gov.au/content/index.phtml/itemId/696340) and 
[Product of birth - Apgar score at 5 minutes](https://meteor.aihw.gov.au/content/index.phtml/itemId/733374).
