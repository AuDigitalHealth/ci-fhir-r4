This profile identifies the additional constraints, extensions, and value sets that build on and extend [BodyStructure](http://hl7.org/fhir/R4/bodystructure.html) that are supported. 

This profile is designed to set a BodyStructure standard for:
* Recording or updating body structures in an AODR record of consent (Consent resource)
* Reading body structures in an AODR record of consent (Consent resource)

Operations, including querying, on body structures in an AODR record of consent (BodyStructure resource) are expected to be within the context of a Consent resource query.

This profile may be referred to by APIs, which will be listed here when available.
