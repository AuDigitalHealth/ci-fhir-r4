In the context of an exchange of health information a related person is part of the context established for a set of healthcare-related information.

This profile identifies the additional constraints, extensions, and value sets that build on and extend [RelatedPerson](http://hl7.org/fhir/R4/relatedperson.html) that are supported. 

A [RelatedPerson](http://hl7.org/fhir/R4/relatedperson.html) resource is used within the context of a referencing resource. 

This profile is designed to set a RelatedPerson standard:
* Recording or updating a related person referenced by another resource in the context of the MHR system
* Reading related persons referenced by another resource in the context of the MHR system

This profile may be referred to by APIs, which will be listed here when available.
